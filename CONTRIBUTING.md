# Contribution Instructions

In order to begin contributing to this repo, you must first fork the repo into your personal github.

Then set a remote for the upstream repo ([this one](https://github.com/KyleBrownCS/-r-winnipegjets-scripts)):
'git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git'

Feel free to work in your local fork however you choose, to bring your code up to date with changes in the original repo:
'git checkout master'
'git merge upstream/master'

You will need to push this back up to origin.

Let me know what feature you are developing and then make a PR. I'll review and merge if appropriate. Feel free to email me for any/all disscussions.
