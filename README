Enable API access to your reddit account by following the documentation [here](http://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/authentication.html#oauth).

After that is compelte, fill in the details below in a new file named `praw_login.py` with your creds and username/password below

```python
import praw

r = praw.Reddit(client_id=<YOUR-CLIENT-ID>,
                client_secret=<YOUR-CLIENT-SECRET>,
                user_agent=<YOUR-USER-AGENT>,
                username=<REDDIT-USERNAME>,
                password=<REDDIT-PASSWORD>)
```

Also clone https://github.com/KyleBrownCS/gspread and make sure you import it properly in drive_manager.py (see import lines near top of file) (this needs to be refactored as currently I've manually added my personal download locations). The default package doesn't work as there was a couple functions that were broken that I wanted to use.

In the -r-winnipeg-jets-scripts directory run `pip install -r requirements.txt` and it should pull in the pip packages.

You'll need to set up google drive API credentials which you can do by following the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/python). Be sure to start from the beginning as you need to enable API calls to/from your account.

Note that you will need to change the `SCOPES` variable in the quickstart to  `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` to allow read and write access to the files we manage for GWG.

Once those are all set up you'll need to configure your own copy of the application_secret.json file. You can use application_secret.json.temp as a template. It should work out of the box. Here are additional notes about the keys and values:

- "-1" represents the team id for the associated data. In our case a "test" team which will automatically be converted to the winnipeg jets team number 52 (for more info on number standards see team id's listed [here](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams/). We use the NHL API so we adhere team ids to their internal values.
- "folder" the folder id for the google drive folder that contains all the goodies (VIPs will be shared access to the current testing folder)
- "admin" a list of users to contact if someone forgets to create a GWG form, and also notifiy when we successfully create the GWG form.
- "reddit" the subreddit that the team id needs to post to. Eg. "winnipegjets" for the winnipegjets reddit. I would recommend making a reddit of your own username and putting your username in this setting as I've done with my own.
- "details" currently only supports previous winners under the "winners" key. built for any extended functionality we may want


Args for gwg bot

`--prod` used for production posting to reddit. no additional data needed

`--test YYYY-MM-DD` used to test the GWG poster for day YYYY-MM-DD. You'll need to have a file in the testing directory that is named GWG X where X is the game number that the day corresponds to. We calulate what game number we are posting for by calculating our record on game day and + 1. (There may be a bug in the code using date in the past since it may contain the current record instead of the record at that point of time)


General Design flow to follow:
